### <h1 align="center" dir="auto"> Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Enes  
  
  
I'm a 22 years old 2nd year Computer Science student living in Istanbul. I love to learn new things and i think my passion about ML and AI just feeds this. I also am curious about generative art (even the header image is generated with stable diffusion). I am only learning python for now but i want to try other things at least a bit in the future. You can contact me whenever you want!
